liver function abnormalities in heart failure,"BACKGROUND	This study analyzed liver function abnormalities in heart failure patients admitted with severe acute decompensated heart failure ( ADHF ) .
RESULTS	A post hoc analysis was conducted with the use of data from the Evaluation Study of Congestive Heart Failure and Pulmonary Artery Catheterization Effectiveness ( ESCAPE ) .
RESULTS	Liver function tests ( LFTs ) were measured at 7 time points from baseline , at discharge , and up to 6 months follow-up .
RESULTS	Survival analyses were used to assess the association between admission Model of End-Stage Liver Disease Excluding International Normalized Ratio ( MELD-XI ) scores and patient outcome.There was a high prevalence of abnormal baseline ( admission ) LFTs ( albumin 23.8 % , aspartate transaminase 23.5 % , alanine transaminase 23.8 % , and total bilirubin 36.1 % ) .
RESULTS	The percentage of patients with abnormal LFTs decreased significantly from baseline to 6-months ' follow-up .
RESULTS	When mean hemodynamic profiles were compared in patients with abnormal versus normal LFTs , elevated total bilirubin was associated with a significantly lower cardiac index ( 1.80 vs 2.1 ; P < .001 ) and higher central venous pressure ( 14.2 vs 12.0 ; P = .03 ) .
RESULTS	Multivariable analyses revealed that patients with elevated MELD-XI scores ( 16.8 ) had a 2-fold ( hazard ratio2 .06 , 95 % confidence interval 1.05-4 .03 ) increased risk of death , rehospitalization , or transplantation after adjusting for baseline LFTs , age , sex , race , body mass index , diabetes , and systolic blood pressure .
CONCLUSIONS	Abnormal LFTs are common in the ADHF population and are a dynamic marker of an impaired hemodynamic state .
CONCLUSIONS	Elevated MELD-XI scores are associated with poor outcomes among patients admitted with ADHF ."
endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ),"BACKGROUND	Minimally invasive endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) could be a surgical technique that improves outcome of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm ( rAAA ) .
BACKGROUND	The aim of this study was to analyse the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility of EVAR compared with standard open repair ( OR ) in the treatment of rAAA , with costs per 30-day and 6-month survivor as outcome parameters .
METHODS	Resource use was determined from the Amsterdam Acute Aneurysm ( AJAX ) trial , a multicentre randomized trial comparing EVAR with OR in patients with rAAA .
METHODS	The analysis was performed from a provider perspective .
METHODS	All costs were calculated as if all patients had been treated in the same hospital ( Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis , teaching hospital ) .
RESULTS	A total of 116 patients were randomized .
RESULTS	The 30-day mortality rate was 21 per cent after EVAR and 25 per cent for OR : absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) 44 ( 95 per cent confidence interval ( c.i. ) -110 to 197 ) per cent .
RESULTS	At 6months , the total mortality rate for EVAR was 28 per cent , compared with 31 per cent among those assigned to OR : ARR 24 ( -142 to 190 ) per cent .
RESULTS	The mean cost difference between EVAR and OR was 5306 ( 95 per cent c.i. -1854 to 12,659 ) at 30days and 10,189 ( -2477 to 24,506 ) at 6months .
RESULTS	The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per prevented death was 120,591 at 30days and 424,542 at 6months .
RESULTS	There was no significant difference in quality of life between EVAR and OR .
RESULTS	Nor was EVAR superior regarding cost-utility .
CONCLUSIONS	EVAR may be more effective for rAAA , but its increased costs mean that it is unaffordable based on current standards of societal willingness-to-pay for health gains ."
social anxiety,"BACKGROUND	Evidence suggests that individuals with social anxiety demonstrate vigilance to social threat , whilst the peptide hormone oxytocin is widely accepted as supporting affiliative behaviour in humans .
METHODS	This study investigated whether oxytocin can affect attentional bias in social anxiety .
METHODS	In a double-blind , randomized , placebo-controlled , within-group study design , 26 healthy and 16 highly socially anxious ( HSA ) male volunteers ( within the HSA group , 10 were diagnosed with generalized social anxiety disorder ) were administered 24 IU of oxytocin or placebo to investigate attentional processing in social anxiety .
METHODS	Attentional bias was assessed using the dot-probe paradigm with angry , fearful , happy and neutral face stimuli .
RESULTS	In the baseline placebo condition , the HSA group showed greater attentional bias for emotional faces than healthy individuals .
RESULTS	Oxytocin reduced the difference between HSA and non-socially anxious individuals in attentional bias for emotional faces .
RESULTS	Moreover , it appeared to normalize attentional bias in HSA individuals to levels seen in the healthy population in the baseline condition .
RESULTS	The biological mechanisms by which oxytocin may be exerting these effects are discussed .
CONCLUSIONS	These results , coupled with previous research , could indicate a potential therapeutic use of this hormone in treatment for social anxiety ."
diesel exhaust causes inflammatory responses,"BACKGROUND	Exposure to diesel exhaust causes inflammatory responses .
BACKGROUND	Previous controlled exposure studies at a concentration of 300 g/m ( 3 ) of diesel exhaust particles mainly lasted for 1 h.
BACKGROUND	We prolonged the exposure period and investigated how quickly diesel exhaust can induce respiratory and systemic effects .
METHODS	Eighteen healthy volunteers were exposed twice to diluted diesel exhaust ( PM1 ~ 300 g/m ( 3 ) ) and twice to filtered air ( PM1 ~ 2 g/m ( 3 ) ) for 3 h , seated , in a chamber with a double-blind set-up .
METHODS	Immediately before and after exposure , we performed a medical examination , spirometry , rhinometry , nasal lavage and blood sampling .
METHODS	Nasal lavage and blood samples were collected again 20 h post-exposure .
METHODS	Symptom scores and peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) were assessed before exposure , and at 15 , 75 , and 135 min of exposure .
RESULTS	Self-rated throat irritation was higher during diesel exhaust than filtered air exposure .
RESULTS	Clinical signs of irritation in the upper airways were also significantly more common after diesel exhaust exposure ( odds ratio = 3.2 , p < 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	PEF increased during filtered air , but decreased during diesel exhaust exposure , with a statistically significant difference at 75 min ( +4 L/min vs. -10 L/min , p = 0.005 ) .
RESULTS	Monocyte and total leukocyte counts in peripheral blood were higher after exposure to diesel exhaust than filtered air 20 h post-exposure , and a trend ( p = 0.07 ) towards increased serum IL-6 concentrations was also observed 20 h post-exposure .
CONCLUSIONS	Diesel exhaust induced acute adverse effects such as symptoms and signs of irritation , decreased PEF , inflammatory markers in healthy volunteers .
CONCLUSIONS	The effects were first seen at 75 min of exposure ."
Depressive disorders,"OBJECTIVE	Depressive disorders are one of the leading components of the global burden of disease with a prevalence of up to 14 % in the general population .
OBJECTIVE	Numerous studies have demonstrated that pharmacotherapy combined with non-pharmacological measures offer the best treatment approach .
OBJECTIVE	Psycho-education as an intervention has been studied mostly in disorders such as schizophrenia and dementia , less so in depressive disorders .
OBJECTIVE	The present study aimed to assess the impact of psycho-education of patients and their caregivers on the outcome of depression .
METHODS	A total of 80 eligible depressed subjects were recruited and randomised into 2 groups .
METHODS	The study group involved an eligible family member and all were offered individual structured psycho-educational modules .
METHODS	Another group ( controls ) received routine counselling .
METHODS	The subjects in both groups also received routine pharmacotherapy and counselling from the treating clinician and were assessed at baseline , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 12 weeks using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) , Global Assessment of Functioning ( GAF ) , and Psychological General Well-Being Index ( PGWBI ) .
METHODS	Results from both groups were compared using statistical methods including Chi-square test , Fisher 's exact test , Student 's t test , Pearson 's correlation coefficient , as well as univariate and multiple regression analyses .
RESULTS	Baseline socio-demographic and assessment measures were similar in both groups .
RESULTS	The study group had consistent improvement in terms of outcome measures with HDRS , GAF , and PGWBI scores showing respective mean change of -15.08 , 22 , and 60 over 12 weeks .
RESULTS	The comparable respective changes in the controls were -8.77 , 18.1 , and 43.25 .
CONCLUSIONS	Structured psycho-education combined with pharmacotherapy is an effective intervention for people with depressive disorders .
CONCLUSIONS	Psycho-education optimises the pharmacological treatment of depression in terms of faster recovery , reduction in severity of depression , and improvement in subjective wellbeing and social functioning ."
sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus and a positive sputum fungal culture,"BACKGROUND	IgE sensitization to Aspergillus fumigatus and a positive sputum fungal culture result are common in patients with refractory asthma .
BACKGROUND	It is not clear whether these patients would benefit from antifungal treatment .
OBJECTIVE	We sought to determine whether a 3-month course of voriconazole improved asthma-related outcomes in patients with asthma who are IgE sensitized to A fumigatus .
METHODS	Asthmatic patients who were IgE sensitized to A fumigatus with a history of at least 2 severe exacerbations in the previous 12 months were treated for 3 months with 200 mg of voriconazole twice daily , followed by observation for 9 months , in a double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized design .
METHODS	Primary outcomes were improvement in quality of life at the end of the treatment period and a reduction in the number of severe exacerbations over the 12 months of the study .
RESULTS	Sixty-five patients were randomized .
RESULTS	Fifty-nine patients started treatment ( 32 receiving voriconazole and 27 receiving placebo ) and were included in an intention-to-treat analysis .
RESULTS	Fifty-six patients took the full 3 months of medication .
RESULTS	Between the voriconazole and placebo groups , there were no significant differences in the number of severe exacerbations ( 1.16 vs 1.41 per patient per year , respectively ; mean difference , 0.25 ; 95 % CI , 0.19-0 .31 ) , quality of life ( change in Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score , 0.68 vs 0.88 ; mean difference between groups , 0.2 ; 95 % CI , -0.05 to -0.11 ) , or any of our secondary outcome measures .
CONCLUSIONS	We were unable to show a beneficial effect of 3 months of treatment with voriconazole in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma who were IgE sensitized to A fumigatus on either the rate of severe exacerbations , quality of life , or other markers of asthma control ."
Patient adherence to appointments is key to improving outcomes in health care,"BACKGROUND	Patient adherence to appointments is key to improving outcomes in health care .
BACKGROUND	`` No-show '' appointments contribute to suboptimal resource use .
BACKGROUND	Patient navigation and telephone reminders have been shown to improve cancer care and adherence , particularly in disadvantaged populations , but may not be cost-effective if not targeted at the appropriate patients .
METHODS	In 5 clinics within a large academic cancer center , patients who were considered to be likely ( the top 20th percentile ) to miss a scheduled appointment without contacting the clinic ahead of time ( `` no-shows '' ) were identified using a predictive model and then randomized to an intervention versus a usual-care group .
METHODS	The intervention group received telephone calls from a bilingual patient navigator 7 days before and 1 day before the appointment .
RESULTS	Over a 5-month period , of the 40,075 appointments scheduled , 4425 patient appointments were deemed to be at high risk of a `` no-show '' event .
RESULTS	After the patient navigation intervention , the no-show rate in the intervention group was 10.2 % ( 167 of 1631 ) , compared with 17.5 % in the control group ( 280 of 1603 ) ( P < .001 ) .
RESULTS	Reaching a patient or family member was associated with a significantly lower no-show rate ( 5.9 % and 3.0 % , respectively ; P < .001 and .006 , respectively ) compared with leaving a message ( 14.7 % : P = .117 ) or no contact ( no-show rate , 21.6 % : P = .857 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Telephone navigation targeted at those patients predicted to be at high risk of visit nonadherence was found to effectively and substantially improve patient adherence to cancer clinic appointments .
CONCLUSIONS	Further studies are needed to determine the long-term impact on patient outcomes , but short-term gains in the optimization of resources can be recognized immediately ."
Insufficient skills in drug dose calculations increase the risk for medication errors,"BACKGROUND	Insufficient skills in drug dose calculations increase the risk for medication errors .
BACKGROUND	Even experienced nurses may struggle with such calculations .
BACKGROUND	Learning flexibility and cost considerations make e-learning interesting as an alternative to classroom teaching .
BACKGROUND	This study compared the learning outcome and risk of error after a course in drug dose calculations for nurses with the two methods .
METHODS	In a randomised controlled open study , nurses from hospitals and primary healthcare were randomised to either e-learning or classroom teaching .
METHODS	Before and after a 2-day course , the nurses underwent a multiple choice test in drug dose calculations : 14 tasks with four alternative answers ( score 0-14 ) , and a statement regarding the certainty of each answer ( score 0-3 ) .
METHODS	High risk of error was being certain that incorrect answer was correct .
METHODS	The results are given as the mean ( SD ) .
RESULTS	16 men and 167 women participated in the study , aged 42.0 ( 9.5 ) years with a working experience of 12.3 ( 9.5 ) years .
RESULTS	The number of correct answers after e-learning was 11.6 ( 2.0 ) and after classroom teaching 11.9 ( 2.0 ) ( p = 0.18 , NS ) ; improvement were 0.5 ( 1.6 ) and 0.9 ( 2.2 ) , respectively ( p = 0.07 , NS ) .
RESULTS	Classroom learning was significantly superior to e-learning among participants with a pretest score below 9 .
RESULTS	In support of e-learning was evaluation of specific value for the working situation .
RESULTS	There was no difference in risk of error between groups after the course ( p = 0.77 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	The study showed no differences in learning outcome or risk of error between e-learning and classroom teaching in drug dose calculations .
CONCLUSIONS	The overall learning outcome was small .
CONCLUSIONS	Weak precourse knowledge was associated with better outcome after classroom teaching ."
volume-time curve technique could be an alternative for endotracheal tube ( ETT ) cuff management,"BACKGROUND	Previous investigation showed that the volume-time curve technique could be an alternative for endotracheal tube ( ETT ) cuff management .
BACKGROUND	However , the clinical impact of the volume-time curve application has not been documented .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this study was to compare the occurrence and intensity of a sore throat , cough , thoracic pain , and pulmonary function between these 2 techniques for ETT cuff management : volume-time curve technique versus minimal occlusive volume ( MOV ) technique after coronary artery bypass grafting .
METHODS	A total of 450 subjects were randomized into 2 groups for cuff management after intubation : MOV group ( n = 222 ) and volume-time curve group ( n = 228 ) .
METHODS	We measured cuff pressure before extubation .
METHODS	We performed spirometry 24 h before and after surgery .
METHODS	We graded sore throat and cough according to a 4-point scale at 1 , 24 , 72 , and 120 h after extubation and assessed thoracic pain at 24 h after extubation and quantified the level of pain by a 10-point scale .
RESULTS	The volume-time curve group presented significantly lower cuff pressure ( 30.9 2.8 vs 37.7 3.4 cm H2O ) , less incidence and intensity of sore throat ( 1 h , 23.7 vs 51.4 % ; and 24 h , 18.9 vs 40.5 % , P < .001 ) , cough ( 1 h , 19.3 vs 48.6 % ; and 24 h , 18.4 vs 42.3 % , P < .001 ) , thoracic pain ( 5.2 1.8 vs 7.1 1.7 ) , better preservation of FVC ( 49.5 9.9 vs 41.8 12.9 % , P = .005 ) , and FEV1 ( 46.6 1.8 vs 38.6 1.4 % , P = .005 ) compared with the MOV group .
CONCLUSIONS	The subjects who received the volume-time curve technique for ETT cuff management presented a significantly lower incidence and severity of sore throat and cough , less thoracic pain , and minimally impaired pulmonary function than those subjects who received the MOV technique during the first 24 h after coronary artery bypass grafting ."
Bicalutamide blocks androgen action and is frequently used in men,"BACKGROUND	Bicalutamide blocks androgen action and is frequently used in men with non-metastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) .
BACKGROUND	By reducing intracellular dihydrotestosterone , dutasteride ( dual 5-alpha reductase inhibitor ) could increase the effectiveness of bicalutamide in this setting .
BACKGROUND	The objective of the study is therefore to prospectively evaluate dutasteride plus bicalutamide in men with asymptomatic , non-metastatic CRPC with rising prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) .
METHODS	Prostate cancer patients with rising PSA whilst on first-line androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) were randomised ( 1:1 ) in a double-blind trial to receive bicalutamide 50mg plus placebo or bicalutamide 50mg plus dutasteride 3.5 mg once daily for 18 months .
METHODS	Randomisation was stratified by centre ; treatment assignments were generated using GlaxoSmithKline 's RandAll System .
METHODS	Subjects who completed 18 months could participate in the 2-year extension .
METHODS	Central laboratory and study sites/monitors remained treatment-blinded .
METHODS	Primary end-point was time to disease progression ( TDP ) up to 42 months ( defined as PSA progression from baseline or nadir , radiographic disease progression , death from prostate cancer or receipt of rescue medication ) .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference in TDP in 127 men treated with bicalutamide/dutasteride ( n = 62 ) compared with bicalutamide/placebo ( n = 65 ) ( hazard ratio ( HR ) = 0.94 [ 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.61 , 1.46 ] ; p = 0.79 ) .
RESULTS	The estimated median TDP was 425 days ( 95 % CI 302 , 858 ) in the bicalutamide/placebo group and 623 days ( 95 % CI 369 , 730 ) in the bicalutamide/dutasteride group .
RESULTS	There was no statistically significant difference between the treatment groups for any secondary efficacy end-points , including time to treatment failure or PSA response .
RESULTS	In the multivariate analysis , age , non-White race , higher baseline testosterone and lower baseline PSA were associated with longer TDP .
RESULTS	Adverse events were comparable between treatment groups .
CONCLUSIONS	In men with non-metastatic CRPC , adding dutasteride to bicalutamide did not significantly prolong TDP .
CONCLUSIONS	Prospective data are provided concerning the common practice of using bicalutamide in this setting ."
Menopause is the stage when the menstrual period permanently stops,"BACKGROUND	Menopause is the stage when the menstrual period permanently stops , and is a part of every woman 's life .
BACKGROUND	It usually occurs between the ages of 40 and 60 years , and is associated with hormonal , physical , and psychological changes .
BACKGROUND	Estrogen and progesterone levels play the biggest part in menopause .
BACKGROUND	In this stage , the ovaries make less estrogen and progesterone .
BACKGROUND	When the body produces less of these hormones , the parts of the body that depend on estrogen to keep them healthy will react and this often causes discomfort for women .
BACKGROUND	This study tested the impact of a complementary health approach to quality of life in menopausal women .
METHODS	A community-based interventional study was conducted in selected areas in Kattankulathur Block , Kanchipuram District , Tamil Nadu , India .
METHODS	A simple random sampling technique was used to select menopausal women for the study .
METHODS	Of 260 menopausal women identified , 130 were allocated to a study group and 130 to a control group .
METHODS	The study group underwent yoga training for 1.5 hours per day on 5 consecutive days .
METHODS	After the 5-day intensive yoga training program , the menopausal women practiced yoga daily at home for 35-40 minutes a day .
METHODS	Along with daily yoga practice , they underwent group yoga practice for 2 days a week under the supervision of one of the investigators until 18 weeks .
METHODS	The yoga training program consisted of Yogasanas , Pranayama ( breathing exercises ) , and meditation .
METHODS	The standardized World Health Organization QoL BREF scale was used to assess the women 's quality of life .
METHODS	We distributed an instruction manual on steps of selected yoga practice for the women 's self-reference at home after the 5 days of continuous yoga practice .
METHODS	A yoga practice diary was used to confirm regular performance of yoga .
METHODS	The women in the control group did not participate in the yoga program ; however , on completion of the study , these women received intensive yoga training for 5 days .
RESULTS	There was an extremely high statistically significant difference ( P = 0.001 ) between the study group and the control group with regard to the physical , psychological , social , and environmental domains of quality of life after 6 , 12 , and 18 weeks of yoga therapy .
RESULTS	The mean gain score was high in all the domains of quality of life in the study group at weeks 6 , 12 , and 18 .
RESULTS	The overall mean gain score in the study group was 31.58 versus 1.61 in the control group .
RESULTS	The overall mean gain score difference was 29.97 in all domains of quality of life between the study group and the control group .
RESULTS	In the study group , the physical , psychological , social , and environmental domains of quality of life were greatly improved by practicing yoga for 18 weeks .
RESULTS	No adverse events were reported by the women after yoga practice .
CONCLUSIONS	Quality of life in menopausal women was greatly improved after 18 weeks of yoga practice .
CONCLUSIONS	Women who regularly practice yoga find that they are able to enjoy menopause and experience the freedom , liberation , and energy that it brings .
CONCLUSIONS	We conclude that yoga is an effective complementary health approach for improving quality of life in menopausal women ."
Constipation has a significant impact on quality of life ,"BACKGROUND	Constipation has a significant impact on quality of life .
BACKGROUND	Aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and the efficacy for relieving dyschezia symptoms of a CO2-releasing suppository in a randomized , placebo-controlled , clinical trial .
METHODS	Fifty-three office-based primary care physicians and 24 gastroenterologists conducted the study in France , between November 2010 and January 2012 .
METHODS	Patients ( aged 18-75 years ) with dyschezia were eligible .
METHODS	Patients were randomly allocated a once-a-day suppository ( CO2-releasing suppository or placebo ) for 21 days .
METHODS	Primary endpoint was the change , from Day 0 to Day 21 , in the intensity of discomfort related to dyschezia based on a self-assessed 0-100 visual analogue scale .
RESULTS	A total of 323 patients were randomized , i.e. 166 into the intervention group and 157 into the placebo group .
RESULTS	Co-variance analysis showed a greater reduction in discomfort visual analogue scale score in the intervention group ( -34.5 mm ; standard error of the mean : 1.8 mm ) than in the placebo group ( -26.2 mm ; standard error of the mean : 1.9 mm ; p < 0.001 ) .
RESULTS	The greater efficacy of the CO2-releasing suppository was confirmed for all secondary efficacy parameters .
RESULTS	No significant side effects for either treatment were observed .
CONCLUSIONS	A CO2-releasing suppository is more effective than a placebo for the relief of symptoms of dyschezia .
CONCLUSIONS	This efficacy is associated with a good safety profile ."
Tubal ectopic pregnancy can be surgically treated by salpingectomy ,"BACKGROUND	Tubal ectopic pregnancy can be surgically treated by salpingectomy , in which the affected Fallopian tube is removed , or salpingotomy , in which the tube is preserved .
BACKGROUND	Despite potentially increased risks of persistent trophoblast and repeat ectopic pregnancy , salpingotomy is often preferred over salpingectomy because the preservation of both tubes is assumed to offer favourable fertility prospects , although little evidence exists to support this assumption .
BACKGROUND	We aimed to assess whether salpingotomy would improve rates of ongoing pregnancy by natural conception compared with salpingectomy .
METHODS	In this open-label , multicentre , international , randomised controlled trial , women aged 18 years and older with a laparoscopically confirmed tubal pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube were randomly assigned via a central internet-based randomisation program to receive salpingotomy or salpingectomy .
METHODS	The primary outcome was ongoing pregnancy by natural conception .
METHODS	Differences in cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates were expressed as a fecundity rate ratio with 95 % CI , calculated by Cox proportional-hazards analysis with a time horizon of 36 months .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes were persistent trophoblast and repeat ectopic pregnancy ( expressed as relative risks [ RRs ] with 95 % CIs ) and ongoing pregnancy after ovulation induction , intrauterine insemination , or IVF .
METHODS	The researchers who collected data for fertility outcomes were masked to the assigned intervention , but patients and the investigators who analysed the data were not .
METHODS	All endpoints were analysed by intention to treat .
METHODS	We also did a ( non-prespecified ) meta-analysis that included the findings from the present trial .
METHODS	This trial is registered , number ISRCTN37002267 .
RESULTS	446 women were randomly assigned between Sept 24 , 2004 , and Nov 29 , 2011 , with 215 allocated to salpingotomy and 231 to salpingectomy .
RESULTS	Follow-up was discontinued on Feb 1 , 2013 .
RESULTS	The cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate was 607 % after salpingotomy and 562 % after salpingectomy ( fecundity rate ratio 106 , 95 % CI 081-138 ; log-rank p = 0678 ) .
RESULTS	Persistent trophoblast occurred more frequently in the salpingotomy group than in the salpingectomy group ( 14 [ 7 % ] vs 1 [ < 1 % ] ; RR 150 , 20-1134 ) .
RESULTS	Repeat ectopic pregnancy occurred in 18 women ( 8 % ) in the salpingotomy group and 12 ( 5 % ) women in the salpingectomy group ( RR 16 , 08-33 ) .
RESULTS	The number of ongoing pregnancies after ovulation induction , intrauterine insemination , or IVF did not differ significantly between the groups .
RESULTS	43 ( 20 % ) women in the salpingotomy group were converted to salpingectomy during the initial surgery because of persistent tubal bleeding .
RESULTS	Our meta-analysis , which included our own results and those of one other study , substantiated the results of the trial .
CONCLUSIONS	In women with a tubal pregnancy and a healthy contralateral tube , salpingotomy does not significantly improve fertility prospects compared with salpingectomy .

diagnostic accuracy of novel biomarkers of myocardial injury,"OBJECTIVE	To examine the diagnostic accuracy of novel biomarkers of myocardial injury and troponin assays for diagnosis of myocardial infarction .
METHODS	850 patients randomised to the point-of-care testing arm of the Randomised Assessment of Panel Assay of Cardiac markers ( RATPAC ) study in six emergency departments of low-risk patients presenting with chest pain were studied .
METHODS	Blood samples were obtained on admission and 90 min from admission .
METHODS	Myocardial infarction was defined by the universal definition of myocardial infarction .
METHODS	The following diagnostic strategies were compared by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis and comparison of area under the curve : individual marker values and the combination of presentation heart fatty acid binding protein ( HFABP ) and copeptin with troponin .
RESULTS	68 patients had a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction .
RESULTS	Admission samples were available from 838/1132 patients enrolled in the study .
RESULTS	Areas under the curve were as follows ( CIs in parentheses ) : cardiac troponin I ( cTnI ) Stratus CS 0.94 ( 0.90 to 0.98 ) , cTnI Beckmann 0.92 ( 0.88 to 0.96 ) , cTnI Siemens ultra 0.90 ( 0.85 to 0.95 ) , cardiac troponin T high sensitivity 0.92 ( 0.88 to 0.96 ) , HFABP 1 0.84 ( 0.77 to 0.90 ) copeptin 0.62 ( 0.57 to 0.68 ) .
RESULTS	HFABP and copeptin were diagnostically inferior to troponin .
RESULTS	The combination of HFABP ( at the 95th percentile ) and troponin ( at the 99th percentile ) increased diagnostic sensitivity .
CONCLUSIONS	High-sensitivity cardiac troponin is the best single marker .
CONCLUSIONS	Addition of HFABP to high-sensitivity troponin increased diagnostic sensitivity .
CONCLUSIONS	Additional measurement of copeptin is not useful in the chest pain population ."
Multidimensional tinnitus models describe dysfunctional cognitions,"BACKGROUND	Multidimensional tinnitus models describe dysfunctional cognitions as a complicating factor in the process of tinnitus habituation .
BACKGROUND	However , this concept has rarely been investigated in previous research .
OBJECTIVE	The present study investigated the effects of two cognitive-behavioral treatments on dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions in patients with chronic tinnitus .
OBJECTIVE	Furthermore , dysfunctional cognitions were examined as possible predictors of the therapeutic effect on tinnitus distress .
METHODS	A total of 128 patients with chronic tinnitus were randomly assigned to either an Internet-delivered guided self-help treatment ( Internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy , ICBT ) , a conventional face-to-face group therapy ( cognitive-behavioral group therapy , GCBT ) , or an active control group in the form of a web-based discussion forum ( DF ) .
METHODS	To assess tinnitus-related dysfunctional thoughts , the Tinnitus Cognitions Scale ( T-Cog ) was used at pre - and post-assessment , as well as at the 6 - and 12-month follow-up .
RESULTS	Multivariate ANOVAs with post hoc tests revealed significant and comparable reductions of dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions for both treatments ( GCBT and ICBT ) , which remained stable over a 6 - and 12-month period .
RESULTS	Negative correlations were found between the catastrophic subscale of the T-Cog and therapy outcome for ICBT , but not for GCBT .
RESULTS	This means a higher degree of catastrophic thinking at baseline was associated with lower benefit from ICBT directly after the treatment .
RESULTS	Hierarchical regression analysis confirmed catastrophizing as a predictor of poorer therapy outcome regarding emotional tinnitus distress in ICBT .
RESULTS	No associations were detected in the follow-up assessments .
CONCLUSIONS	Both forms of CBT are successful in reducing dysfunctional tinnitus-related cognitions .
CONCLUSIONS	Catastrophizing significantly predicted a less favorable outcome regarding emotional tinnitus distress in ICBT .
CONCLUSIONS	Clinical implications of these results are described .
CONCLUSIONS	Dysfunctional cognitions could be targeted more intensively in therapy and in future research on tinnitus ."
Handling emergency telephone consultations ( ETCs ) ,"OBJECTIVE	Handling emergency telephone consultations ( ETCs ) is a challenging and very important task for doctors .
OBJECTIVE	The aims of the study were to document insecurity in medical students during ETCs and to identify the reasons for that insecurity .
OBJECTIVE	We hypothesised that insecurity is associated with advising more urgent action ( e.g. advice to call for an ambulance ) in ETCs .
METHODS	We used ETCs with simulated patients ( SPs ) , with each student randomly allocated two of four possible cases .
METHODS	After the training , 137 students reported on any insecurity that they had in the various ETC phases .
METHODS	We analysed the reasons for insecurity using descriptive statistics .
METHODS	The association between the students ' advice that urgent action was needed and their insecurity was analysed with Spearman rank correlation .
RESULTS	Overall , 95 % of the students felt insecure in at least one phase of their ETC. .
RESULTS	History taking was the phase in which students felt most insecure ( 63.1 % ) , followed by the phase of analysing the information given by the patient ( 44.9 % ) .
RESULTS	Perceived insecurity was associated with more urgent advice in one case scenario ( abdominal pain ; correlation r = 0.46 ; p < 0.01 ) .
RESULTS	The other two cases ( child with fever ; chest pain ) also had a positive , but not statistically significant , correlation trend ( p < 0.12 ; p < 0.08 ) .
CONCLUSIONS	Insecurity is highly prevalent among medical students in their ETC decision-making .
CONCLUSIONS	ETC training in medical schools , with a focus on structured history taking and formulating discriminating questions , might help decrease insecurity in ETCs .
CONCLUSIONS	Medical education should also teach management of insecurity ."
Brain lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) ,"BACKGROUND	Brain lesions on diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) are frequently found after carotid artery stenting ( CAS ) , but their clinical relevance remains unclear .
OBJECTIVE	This study sought to investigate whether periprocedural ischemic DWI lesions after CAS or carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) are associated with an increased risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events .
METHODS	In the magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) substudy of ICSS ( International Carotid Stenting Study ) , 231 patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis were randomized to undergo CAS ( n = 124 ) or CEA ( n = 107 ) .
METHODS	MRIs were performed 1 to 7 days before and 1 to 3 days after treatment .
METHODS	The primary outcome event was stroke or transient ischemic attack in any territory occurring between the post-treatment MRI and the end of follow-up .
METHODS	Time to occurrence of the primary outcome event was compared between patients with ( DWI + ) and without ( DWI - ) new DWI lesions on the post-treatment scan in the CAS and CEA groups separately .
RESULTS	Median time of follow-up was 4.1 years ( interquartile range : 3.0 to 5.2 ) .
RESULTS	In the CAS group , recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack occurred more often among DWI + patients ( 12 of 62 ) than among DWI - patients ( 6 of 62 ) , with a cumulative 5-year incidence of 22.8 % ( standard error [ SE ] : 7.1 % ) and 8.8 % ( SE : 3.8 % ) , respectively ( unadjusted hazard ratio : 2.85 ; 95 % confidence interval : 1.05 to 7.72 ; p = 0.04 ) .
RESULTS	In DWI + and DWI - patients , 8 and 2 events , respectively , occurred within 6 months after treatment .
RESULTS	In the CEA group , there was no difference in recurrent cerebrovascular events between DWI + and DWI - patients .
CONCLUSIONS	Ischemic brain lesions discovered on DWI after CAS seem to be a marker of increased risk for recurrent cerebrovascular events .
CONCLUSIONS	Patients with periprocedural DWI lesions might benefit from more aggressive and prolonged antiplatelet therapy after CAS .

Misoprostol is established for the treatment of incomplete abortion ,"BACKGROUND	Misoprostol is established for the treatment of incomplete abortion but has not been systematically assessed when provided by midwives at district level in a low-resource setting .
BACKGROUND	We investigated the effectiveness and safety of midwives diagnosing and treating incomplete abortion with misoprostol , compared with physicians .
METHODS	We did a multicentre randomised controlled equivalence trial at district level at six facilities in Uganda .
METHODS	Eligibility criteria were women with signs of incomplete abortion .
METHODS	We randomly allocated women with first-trimester incomplete abortion to clinical assessment and treatment with misoprostol either by a physician or a midwife .
METHODS	The randomisation ( 1:1 ) was done in blocks of 12 and was stratified for study site .
METHODS	Primary outcome was complete abortion not needing surgical intervention within 14-28 days after initial treatment .
METHODS	The study was not masked .
METHODS	Analysis of the primary outcome was done on the per-protocol population with a generalised linear-mixed effects model .
METHODS	The predefined equivalence range was -4 % to 4 % .
METHODS	The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01844024 .
RESULTS	From April 30 , 2013 , to July 21 , 2014 , 1108 women were assessed for eligibility .
RESULTS	1010 women were randomly assigned to each group ( 506 to midwife group and 504 to physician group ) .
RESULTS	955 women ( 472 in the midwife group and 483 in the physician group ) were included in the per-protocol analysis .
RESULTS	452 ( 958 % ) of women in the midwife group had complete abortion and 467 ( 967 % ) in the physician group .
RESULTS	The model-based risk difference for midwife versus physician group was -08 % ( 95 % CI -29 to 14 ) , falling within the predefined equivalence range ( -4 % to 4 % ) .
RESULTS	The overall proportion of women with incomplete abortion was 38 % ( 36/955 ) , similarly distributed between the two groups ( 42 % [ 20/472 ] in the midwife group , 33 % [ 16/483 ] in the physician group ) .
RESULTS	No serious adverse events were recorded .
CONCLUSIONS	Diagnosis and treatment of incomplete abortion with misoprostol by midwives is equally safe and effective as when provided by physicians , in a low-resource setting .
CONCLUSIONS	Scaling up midwives ' involvement in treatment of incomplete abortion with misoprostol at district level would increase access to safe post-abortion care .

Much of the existing literature on physical activity ( PA ) interventions,"BACKGROUND	Much of the existing literature on physical activity ( PA ) interventions involves physically inactive individuals recruited from community settings rather than clinical practice settings .
BACKGROUND	Recruitment of patients into interventions in clinical practice settings is difficult due to limited time available in the clinic , identification of appropriate personnel to efficiently conduct the process , and time-consuming methods of recruitment .
BACKGROUND	The purpose of this report is to describe the approach used to identify and recruit veterans from the Veterans Affairs ( VA ) Pittsburgh Healthcare System Primary Care Clinic into a randomized controlled PA study .
METHODS	A sampling frame of veterans was developed using the VA electronic medical record .
METHODS	During regularly scheduled clinic appointments , primary care providers ( PCPs ) screened identified patients for safety to engage in moderate-intensity PA and willingness to discuss the study with research staff members .
METHODS	Research staff determined eligibility with a subsequent telephone screening call and scheduled a research study appointment , at which time signed informed consent and baseline measurements were obtained .
RESULTS	Of the 3,482 veterans in the sampling frame who were scheduled for a primary care appointment during the study period , 1,990 ( 57.2 % ) were seen in the clinic and screened by the PCP ; moderate-intensity PA was deemed safe for 1,293 ( 37.1 % ) , 871 ( 25.0 % ) agreed to be contacted for further screening , 334 ( 9.6 % ) were eligible for the study , and 232 ( 6.7 % ) enrolled .
CONCLUSIONS	Using a semiautomated screening approach that combined an electronically-derived sampling frame with paper and pencil prescreening by PCPs and research staff , VA-STRIDE was able to recruit 1 in 15 veterans in the sampling frame .
CONCLUSIONS	Using this approach , a high proportion of potentially eligible veterans were screened by their PCPs .

Postnatal common mental disorders among women are an important public health problem internationally,"BACKGROUND	Postnatal common mental disorders among women are an important public health problem internationally .
BACKGROUND	Interventions to prevent postnatal depression have had limited success .
BACKGROUND	What Were We Thinking ( WWWT ) is a structured , gender-informed , psychoeducational group programme for parents and their first infant that addresses two modifiable risks to postnatal mental health .
BACKGROUND	This paper describes the protocol for a cluster randomised controlled trial to test the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of WWWT when implemented in usual primary care .
METHODS	48 maternal and child health ( MCH ) centres from six diverse Local Government Areas , in Victoria , Australia are randomly allocated to the intervention group ( usual care plus WWWT ) or the control group ( usual care ) .
METHODS	The required sample size is 184 women in each group .
METHODS	English-speaking primiparous women receiving postpartum healthcare in participating MCH centres complete two computer-assisted telephone interviews : baseline at 4weeks and outcome at 6months postpartum .
METHODS	Women attending intervention MCH centres are invited to attend WWWT in addition to usual care .
METHODS	The primary outcome is meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV ( DSM-IV ) diagnostic criteria for major depressive episode ; generalised anxiety disorder ; panic disorder with or without agoraphobia , agoraphobia with or without panic , social phobia , adult separation anxiety or adjustment disorder with depressed mood , anxiety or mixed depressed mood and anxiety within the past 30days at 6months postpartum .
METHODS	Secondary outcomes are self-rated general and emotional health , infant sleep problems , method of infant feeding , quality of mother-infant relationship and intimate partner relationship , and healthcare costs and outcomes .
BACKGROUND	Approval to conduct the study has been granted .
BACKGROUND	A comprehensive dissemination plan has been devised .
